In this project, the initial focus is on cleaning and preparing a dataset containing detailed information about flats in Gurgaon. The data cleaning process ensures that the dataset is consistent, reliable, and ready for further analysis or modeling.\n","\n","### Overview of the Data Cleaning Steps\n","#### 1. Loading and Inspecting the Data\n","* The dataset is imported directly from a raw CSV file hosted online.\n","\n","* Initial inspection includes viewing random samples and checking data types, which were found to be mostly object (string) types.\n","\n","#### 2. Handling Unnecessary and Duplicate Data\n","* Columns that do not contribute to price prediction (such as link and property_id) are dropped.\n","\n","* Duplicate entries are identified and can be removed to avoid redundancy.\n","\n","#### 3. Managing Missing Values\n","* A column-wise check is performed to identify missing values.\n","\n","* For columns like bedRoom, rows with missing values are removed if other critical fields are also missing.\n","\n","* For categorical fields such as additionalRoom and facing, missing values are filled with a placeholder ('not available') and standardized to lowercase for consistency.\n","\n","#### 4. Data Type Conversion and Feature Engineering\n","* Numerical columns stored as strings (e.g., price, pricePerSqft, bedRoom, bathroom) are converted to appropriate numeric types after cleaning and formatting.\n","\n","* The balcony column, which sometimes contains ambiguous values like '3+', is cleaned by extracting numeric values and handling 'No' as zero.\n","\n","* The floorNum column is standardized by converting textual representations (e.g., 'Ground', 'Basement') to numeric values.\n","\n","#### 5. Cleaning and Standardizing Categorical Data\n","* The society column, which contains many unique values and ratings, is cleaned by removing rating symbols and converting all entries to lowercase.\n","\n","* Categorical columns are prepared for future encoding, with consideration given to the high cardinality of some fields.\n","\n","#### 6. Feature Creation\n","* New features such as area (calculated from price and price per square foot) and property_type are created to enrich the dataset and provide more predictive power.\n","\n","#### 7. Exporting the Cleaned Data\n","* The final cleaned dataset is saved as a new CSV file, ready for use in modeling and analysis."],"metadata":{"id":"C9N2dnIUJ7W2"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"_ayEl_me4JtR","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1752289241884,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":577,"user":{"displayName":"Pranta
